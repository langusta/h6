   An Introduction to **h6** package
=======================================
   
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(h6)
```


Introduction
------------
   
   
   The  **h6** package is a solution of homework 6 of R Advanced Programming course. It consists of three functions: mode, simplify2array2 and perms. More about the course: https://courses.ipipan.edu.pl/simple.php?page=syllabus018.html.



Functions:
----------------------------
   There are three functions included in the package:

- mode - returns most frequent value from given integer vector,
- perms - computes all permutations of the set {1,2,...,n} for any given n,
- simplify2array2 - simplifies a list into an array (if possible).

Examples
-----------------------------

```{r}
mode(c(1,2,3,1,4,5,1,2,6,1))
perms(4)
simplify2array2(list(1:2,2:3,3:4))
simplify2array2(list(1:2,2:3,3))
```
